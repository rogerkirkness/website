Virtual reality encompasses anything both visual and digital. If it requires our focused attention and is delivered over the internet, it is virtual reality. The internet and AI together are a new force of nature, converging our nervous system by way of it’s inputs our eyes and ears into virtual reality. Unless we become aware of the effects that near constantly engaging with virtual reality will have, our humanity will become the final frontier for virtual reality to conquer.

Most of people’s time is already spent in virtual reality. We consume entertaining content to and from work, whether podcasts, videos, music or games. We work in virtual reality, collaborating with peers through video calls and workflow software, whether in person together or not. We group chat with friends through dinner, then watch videos in the evening. Each time of the day and human pattern of need has been met with virtual reality technology designed to serve it.

There are several related questions that I have been thinking about as it relates to virtual reality:

* Could I be making errors of omission in my life because I lack time and attention to become aware of what those omissions might be? Could this play a role at all in fertility or loneliness? 
* What incentives are there for virtual reality platforms to protect my need to love, connect with, depend on others and have them depend on me? Are there any?
* What effect will it have on my memory and emotional experience of life to have user experienced aligned visual and digital services omnipresent in my life?
* As AI progresses, the incentive of virtual reality platforms is to increase it’s market share of time that I don’t spend focused on my immediate survival needs. Can I counter act that?
* If I become an ascetic monk about virtual reality, avoid TikTok, Netflix, Slack and all those services which rob me of my attention, will the people I love choose the same?

I don’t have satisfying answers to these questions. And because Universities have become ineffective at both their original and revised purpose, I don’t think they do either. Virtual reality platforms do not share my incentives or my desire to remain in touch with my humanness. Governments are unable to contain people’s desire to remain in virtual reality - if most of a democratic electorate wants their addictions enabled, it will be so. So I know I must depend on myself, but I have more questions than answers when it comes to countervailing virtual reality.

There are some changes I have made in my life that have not been easy changes in order to spend less of my time in virtual reality:

* I no longer watch videos unless absolutely essential for my job. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with videos, but the more I step back from them, the more clearly I can think.
* I question how important every form of virtual reality platform is in my life, and bias towards elimination. I do this at work, like doing voice rather than video calls, and at home.
* I am very judicious about whether to allow an algorithm to direct my attention. I intentionally block algorithmic feeds like Facebook, LinkedIn, Reddit and YouTube entirely.
* I have cultivated offline hobbies that require my eyes and ears. I bought an axe that I sharpen myself to make firewood. I read physical books. 
* I go on walks at different times of day with an anthropological goal. To observe people, and notice how they behave with their attachments to virtual reality, and learn.
* I encourage those that I am responsible for, both at home with my family, among friends and extended family, and at work with my team to become aware of virtual reality.

I think that virtual reality is only going to become more compelling and all consuming in the future. The Sci-Fi I most enjoy, from Dune to The Unincorporated Man, imagine futures in which virtual reality no longer exists at all. I share that vision.
